> [!WARNING]  
> This repository is **not** currently in HACS, so cannot yet be searched for there.  While [this PR](https://github.com/hacs/default/pull/2535) remains open, you must install manually using the [Manually in HACS](#manually-in-hacs) instructions below: 

> [!NOTE]
> The use of beta versions can be a simple way to fix issues. Check the releases at https://github.com/BJReplay/ha-solcast-solar/releases to see if an issue has already been resolved. If so, turn ```Show beta versions``` on when re-downloading from HACS. Your feedback from testing betas will be most welcome in the repository discussions. https://github.com/BJReplay/ha-solcast-solar/discussions.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This repository may only be sporadically maintained.  Breaking API changes from Solcast will be maintained on a best efforts basis.
>
> Collaborators are welcome, as are PRs for enhancements.
>
> Bug reports unrelated to API changes may not get the attention you want, as the repository owner is largely retired for medical reasons, but knows the Solcast API as a former user in this and other projects.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration can be used as a replacement for the oziee/ha-solcast-solar integration, which has been removed from GitHub and HACS.  
>
> Uninstalling the Oziee version then installing this one will preserve the history and configuration from that prior integration.

Version Change Notes: See [below](#changes).

Home Assistant (https://www.home-assistant.io) Integration Component

This custom component integrates the Solcast Hobby PV Forecast API into Home Assistant.

[<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1471841/135556872-ff5b51ac-699e-4ea5-869c-f9b0d0c5b815.png" width="300">](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1471841/135556872-ff5b51ac-699e-4ea5-869c-f9b0d0c5b815.png)

> [!NOTE]  
> Solcast have altered their API limits for new account creators
>
> Solcast now only offer new account creators 10 API calls per day (used to be 50). 
> Old account users still have 50 API calls.
> 
> The integration currently no longer includes auto API polling. Users now need to create their own automations to call the update solcast service to poll for new data. Keep in mind your API poll limit.

## Solcast Requirements:
Sign up for an API key (https://solcast.com/).

> Solcast may take up to 24hrs to create the account.

Copy the API Key for use with this integration (See [Configuration](#Configuration) below).

## Installation

### HACS *(recommended)*

Using HACS. More info [here](https://hacs.xyz/)  

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=BJReplay&repository=ha-solcast-solar&category=integration)

#### Manually in HACS  

More info [here](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/)

1. (If using it, remove oziee/ha-solcast-solar in HACS)
1. Add custom repository (three verical dots menu, top right) ```https://github.com/BJReplay/ha-solcast-solar``` as an ```integration```
1. Search for 'Solcast' in HACS, open it and click the ```Download``` button
1. See [Configuration](#configuration) below

If previously using Oziee's ha-solcast-solar then all history and config should remain.

<summary><h3>Manually</summary></h3>

You probably **do not** want to do this! Use the HACS method above unless you know what you are doing and have a good reason as to why you are installing manually.

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find ```configuration.yaml```)
1. If you do not have a ```custom_components``` directory there, you need to create it
1. In the ```custom_components``` directory create a new folder called ```solcast_solar```
1. Download _all_ the files from the ```custom_components/solcast_solar/``` directory in this repository
1. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory you created
1. *Restart HA to load the new integration*
1. See [Configuration](#configuration) below

## Configuration

1. [Click Here](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=solcast_solar) to directly add a `Solcast Solar` integration **or**<br/>
 a. In Home Assistant, go to Settings -> [Integrations](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations/)<br/>
 b. Click `+ Add Integrations` and select `Solcast PV Forecast`<br/>
1. Enter your `Solcast API Key`
1. Click `Submit`

* Create your own [automation](#services) to call the service `solcast_solar.update_forecasts` when you would like to update the Solar forecast within Home Assistant.

* Change the configuration options for an existing `Solcast PV Forecast` integration in the Home Assistant Integrations by selecting Solcast then `Configure` (cog wheel).

* If you have more than one Solcast account because you have more than 2 rooftop setups, enter both account API keys separated by a comma `xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx,yyyyyyyy-yyyyy-yyyy` (_NB: this goes against Solcast T&C's by having more than one account_).

* Make sure you enter your `API Key` not your rooftop id created in Solcast. You can find your API key here [api key](https://toolkit.solcast.com.au/account).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After the integration is started, review the Home Assistant log.
> 
> Should an error that gathering rooftop sites data has failed occur then this is not an integration issue, rather a Solcast API issue. The best course of action is to restart the integration, or Home Assistant entirely, and monitor until the sites data can be acquired. Until rooftop sites data is acquired the integration cannot function.
>
> The integration does attempt retries when the Solcast API is busy, but sometimes even this does not help.

## Dampening Configuration

New in v4.0.8 is the option to configure hourly dampening values.

[<img src="https://github.com/BJReplay/ha-solcast-solar/blob/v3/.github/SCREENSHOTS/reconfig.png" width="200">](https://github.com/BJReplay/ha-solcast-solar/blob/v3/.github/SCREENSHOTS/reconfig.png)

[<img src="https://github.com/BJReplay/ha-solcast-solar/blob/v3/.github/SCREENSHOTS/damp.png" width="200">](https://github.com/BJReplay/ha-solcast-solar/blob/v3/.github/SCREENSHOTS/damp.png)

Here you can change the dampening factor value for any hour. Values from 0.0 - 1.0 are valid. Setting 0.95 will dampen each Solcast forecast data value by 5%. This is reflected in the sensor values and attributes and also in the Home Assistant Energy dashboard.

[<img src="https://github.com/BJReplay/ha-solcast-solar/blob/v3/.github/SCREENSHOTS/dampopt.png" width="200">](https://github.com/BJReplay/ha-solcast-solar/blob/v3/.github/SCREENSHOTS/dampopt.png)

## Key Solcast concepts

Solcast will produce a forecast of your solar PV generation for today, tomorrow, the day after (day 3), ... up to day 7.
Each of these forecasts will be in a separate sensor (see below) and the sensor value will be the total predicted solar generation for your Solcast account for each day.
Separate sensors contain peak solar generation power, peak solar generation time, and various forecasts of next hour, 30 minutes, etc.

If you have multiple arrays on different roof orientations, these can be configured in Solcast as separate 'sites' with differing azimuth, tilt and generation, to a maximum of two sites for a free hobbyist account.

Three solar PV generation estimates are produced by the Solcast integration:
- 'central' or 50% or most likely to occur PV forecast (or the `forecast`),
- '10%' or 1 in 10 'worst case' PV forecast assuming more cloud coverage (`forecast10`)
- '90%' or 1 in 10 'best case' PV forecast assuming less cloud coverage (`forecast90`)

The detail of these different forecast estimates can be found in sensor attributes, broken down by 30 minute and hourly invervals across the day. Separate attributes sum the different estimates for each day.

## Services
These are the services for this integration: ([Configuration](#configuration))

| Service | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `solcast_solar.update_forecasts` | Updates the future forecast data only |
| `solcast_solar.clear_all_solcast_data` | Deletes the `solcast.json` cached file |
| `solcast_solar.query_forecast_data` | Returns a list of forecast data using a datetime range start - end |
| `solcast_solar.set_dampening` | Updates the hourly dampening factors |
| `solcast_solar.set_hard_limit` | Set inverter forecast hard limit |
| `solcast_solar.remove_hard_limit` | Remove inverter forecast hard limit |

### Basic HA Automation to poll Solcast API data
Create a new automation and setup your prefered trigger times to poll for new Solcast forecast data.  
These are examples, so alter these or create your own to fit your own needs.

**Recommended**

To make the most of the available API calls, you can have the automation call the API using an interval calculated by the number of daytime hours divided by the number of total API calls a day you can make.

This automation bases execution times on sunrise and sunset, which differ around the globe, so inherently spreads the load on Solcast. It also incorporates a randomised time offset. This will hopefully avoid the likelihood that the Solcast servers get inundated by multiple callers at the same time.

```yaml
alias: Solcast update
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: template
    value_template: >-
      {% set nr = as_datetime(state_attr('sun.sun','next_rising')) | as_local %}
      {% set ns = as_datetime(state_attr('sun.sun','next_setting')) | as_local %}
      {% set api_request_limit = 10 %}
      {% if nr > ns %}
        {% set nr = nr - timedelta(hours = 24) %} 
      {% endif %}
      {% set hours_difference = (ns - nr) %}
      {% set interval_hours = hours_difference / api_request_limit %}
      {% set ns = namespace(match = false) %}
      {% for i in range(api_request_limit) %}
        {% set start_time = nr + (i * interval_hours) %}
        {% if ((start_time - timedelta(seconds=30)) <= now()) and (now() <= (start_time + timedelta(seconds=30))) %}
          {% set ns.match = true %}
        {% endif %}
      {% endfor %}
      {{ ns.match }}
condition:
  - condition: sun
    before: sunset
    after: sunrise
action:
  - delay:
      seconds: "{{ range(30, 360)|random|int }}"
  - service: solcast_solar.update_forecasts
    data: {}
mode: single
```

> [!NOTE]  
> If you have two arrays on your roof then 2 api calls will be made for each update, effectively reducing the number of updates to 5 per day. For this case, change to: `api_request_limit = 5`

The next automation also includes a rendomisation so that calls aren't made at precisely the same time, hopefully avoiding the likelihood that the Solcast servers are inundated by multiple calls at the same time, but it triggers every four hours between sunrise and sunset:

```yaml
alias: Solcast_update
description: New API call Solcast
trigger:
 - platform: time_pattern
   hours: /4
condition:
 - condition: sun
   before: sunset
   after: sunrise
action:
 - delay:
     seconds: "{{ range(30, 360)|random|int }}"
 - service: solcast_solar.update_forecasts
   data: {}
mode: single
```

The next automation triggers at 4am, 10am and 4pm, with a random delay.

```yaml
alias: Solcast update
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: time
    at: "4:00:00"
  - platform: time
    at: "10:00:00"
  - platform: time
    at: "16:00:00"
condition: []
action:
  - delay:
      seconds: "{{ range(30, 360)|random|int }}"
  - service: solcast_solar.update_forecasts
    data: {}
mode: single
```

> [!TIP]
> The Solcast Servers seem to occasionally be under some strain, and the servers return 429 return codes when they are busy.
> The Solcast integration will automatically pause, then retry the connection several times, but occasionally even this strategy can fail to download Solcast data.
> Changing your API Key is not a solution, nor is uninstalling and re-installing the Solcast PV Solar Integration.
> These "tricks" might appear to work, but all that has actually happened is that you have tried again later, and the integration has worked as the Solcast servers are less busy.
> 
> If you think that have problems in the integration, make sure that you have logging turned on, and capture logs to find out if you are getting messages indicating that the Solcast API is busy - these indicate that the Solcast API is under stress.
> Log capture instructions are in the Bug Issue Template - you will see them if you start creating a new issue - make sure you include logs if you want the assistance of the repository constributors.
> An example of busy messages and a retry are shown below.

v4.0.33
* Performance improvements for sensor updates by @isorin, including:
  * Reduced the update interval of sensors to 5 minutes
  * Split the sensors into two groups: sensors that need to be updated every 5 minutes and sensors that need to be updated only when the data is refreshed or the date changes (daily values)
  * Fixed issues with removing the past forecasts (older than 2 years), broken code
  * Improve the functionality of the forecasts, for exmaple "forecast_remaining_today" is updated every 5 minutes by calculating the remaining energy from the current 30 minute interval. Same for "now/next hour" sensors.
* Redaction of Solcast API key in logs by @isorin
* Revert Oziee '4.0.23' async_update_options #54 by @autoSteve, which was causing dampening update issues

A comment from @isorin: "_I use the forecast_remaining_today to determine the time of the day when to start charging the batteries so that they will reach a predetermined charge in the evening. With my changes, this is possible._"

To that, I say nicely done.

v4.0.25
- HACS Submission

v4.0.24
- More changes to remove links to https://github.com/oziee that were missed the first time around
- More changes to prepare to submit to HACSs

v4.0.23
- Changed Owner to @BJReplay
- Changed Github Repo to https://github.com/BJReplay/ha-solcast-solar

v4.0.22
- this time weather sensor is gone.. and midnight UTC reset works
- (*)added a config for setting a hard limit for inverters with over sized solar arrays 
   *99.9999999% of users will not need to ever user and set this (0.00000001% is @CarrapiettM)

v4.0.21
- removed weather sensor as it keeps failing with errors

v4.0.20
- fixed the info error for `solcast_pv_forecast_forecast_today (<class 'custom_components.solcast_solar.sensor.SolcastSensor'>) is using state class 'measurement' which is impossible considering device class ('energy')`
- removed the midnight UTC fetch and replaced with set to zero to reduce the polling on Solcast system
⚠️ To help reduce impact on the Solcast backend, Solcast have asked that users set their automations for polling with a random min and sec timing.. if you are polling at say 10:00 set it to 10:04:10 for instance so that everyone is not polling the services at the same time

v4.0.19
- fix resetting api limit/usage not updating HA UI

v4.0.18
- fixed weather sensor value not persisting 
- reset the api limit and usage sensors at UTC midnight (reset usage)

v4.0.17
- updated Slovak translation thanks @misa1515
- added sensor for Solcast weather description

v4.0.16
- added @Zachoz idea of adding a setting to select which solcast estimate field value for the forecast calculations, either estimate, estimate10 or estimate90
    ESTIMATE - Default forecasts
    ESTIMATE10 = Forecasts 10 - cloudier than expected scenario  
    ESTIMATE90 = Forecasts 90 - less cloudy than expected scenario  

v4.0.15
- added custom 'Next X hours' sensor. You select the number of hours to be calculated as the sensor
- added French translation thanks to @Dackara
- added some sensors to be included in HA statistics data

v4.0.14
- changed attrib values from rooftop sites so pins are not added to maps (HA auto adds item to the map if attributes contain lat/long values)
- added Urdu thanks to @yousaf465

v4.0.13
- added Slovak translation thanks to @misa1515
- extended polling connection timeout from 60s to 120s
- added some more debug output points for data checking
- new forecast data attribute `dataCorrect` returns True of False if the data is complete for that day.
- removed `0 of 48` debug message for the 7th day forecast because if the api is not polled at midnight then the data is not complete for the 7th day (limitation of the max records Solcast returns)

v4.0.12
- HA 2023.11 beta forces sensors not to be listed under `Configuration`. The rooftop sensors have been moved to `Diagnostic`

v4.0.11
- better handling when data is missing pieces for some sensors

v4.0.10
- fixes for changing API key once one has previously been set

v4.0.9
- new service to update forecast hourly dampening factors

v4.0.8
- added Polish translation thanks to @home409ca
- added new `Dampening` to the Solcast Integration configuration

v4.0.7
- better handling when Solcast site does not return API data correctly

v4.0.6
- fixed divide by zero errors if there is no returned data
- fixed renaining today forecast value. now includes current 30min block forecast in the calculation

v4.0.5
- PR #192 - updated German translation.. thanks @florie1706
- fixed `Remaining Today` forecast.. it now also uses the 30min interval data
- fixed `Download diagnostic` data throwing an error when clicked

v4.0.4
- finished off the service call `query_forecast_data` to query the forecast data. Returns a list of forecast data using a datetime range start - end
- and thats all.. unless HA makes breaking changes or there is a major bug in v4.0.4, this is the last update

v4.0.3
- updated German thanks to @florie1706 PR#179 and removed all other localisation files
- added new attribute `detailedHourly` to each daily forecast sensor listing hourly forecasts in kWh
- if there is data missing, sensors will still show something but a debug log will outpout that the sensor is missing data


v4.0.2
- sensor names **have** changed!! this is due to locali(s/z)ation strings of the integration
- decimal percision changed for forecast tomorrow from 0 to 2
- fixed 7th day forecast missing data that was being ignored
- added new sensor `Power Now`
- added new sensor `Power Next 30 Mins`
- added new sensor `Power Next Hour`
- added locali(s/z)ation for all objects in the integation.. thanks to @ViPeR5000 for getting me started on thinking about this (google translate used, if you find anything wrong PR and i can update the translations)

v4.0.1
- rebased from 3.0.55
- keeps the last 730 days (2 years) of forecast data
- some sensors have have had their device_class and native_unit_of_measurement updated to a correct type
- API polling count is read directly from Solcast and is no longer calcuated
- no more auto polling.. its now up to every one to create an automation to poll for data when you want. This is due to so many users now only have 10 api calls a day
- striped out saving UTC time changing and keeping solcast data as it is so timezone data can be changed when needed
- history items went missing due to the sensor renamed. no longer using the HA history and instead just dtoring the data in the solcast.json file
- removed update actuals service.. actuals data from solcast is no longer polled (it is used on the first install to get past data so the integration works and i dont get issue reports because solcast do not give full day data, only data from when you call)
- lots of the logging messages have been updated to be debug,info,warning or errors
- some sensors **COULD** possibly no longer have extra attribute values or attribute values may have been renamed or have changed to the data storaged within
- greater in depth diagnostic data to share when needed to help debug any issues
- some of @rany2 work has been now integrated

Removed 3.1.x
- too many users could not handle the power of this release
- v4.x.x replaces 3.0.55 - 3.1.x with new changes

v3.0.47
- added attribute weekday name for sensor forecasts, today, tomorrow, D3..7
  can read the names via the template 
{{ state_attr('sensor.solcast_forecast_today', 'dayname') }}
{{ state_attr('sensor.solcast_forecast_today', 'dayname') }}
{{ state_attr('sensor.solcast_forecast_tomorrow', 'dayname') }}
{{ state_attr('sensor.solcast_forecast_D3', 'dayname') }}
{{ state_attr('sensor.solcast_forecast_D4', 'dayname') }}
{{ state_attr('sensor.solcast_forecast_D5', 'dayname') }}
{{ state_attr('sensor.solcast_forecast_D6', 'dayname') }}
{{ state_attr('sensor.solcast_forecast_D7', 'dayname') }}

v3.0.46
- possile Maria DB problem - possible fix

v3.0.45

v3.0.43
- pre release not for use!!
- do not install :) just for testing

v3.0.42
- fixed using the service to update forecasts from calling twice

v3.0.41
- recoded logging. Re-worded. More debug vs info vs error logging.
- API usage counter was not recorded when reset to zero at UTC midnight
- added a new service where you can call to update the Solcast Actuals data for the forecasts
- added the version info to the intergation UI

v3.0.40
- someone left some unused code in 3.0.39 causing problems

v3.0.39
- removed version info

v3.0.38
- error with v3.0.37 fix for updating sensors

v3.0.37
- make sure the hourly sensors update when auto polling is disabled

v3.0.36
- includes all pre release items
- actual past accurate data is now set to only poll the API at midday and last hour of the day (so only twice a day)

v3.0.35 - PRE RELEASE
- extended the internet connection timeout to 60s

v3.0.34 - PRE RELEASE
- added service to clear old solcast.json file to have a clean start
- return empty energy graph data if there is an error generating info

v3.0.33
- added sensors for forecast days 3,4,5,6,7

v3.0.32
- refactored HA setup function call requirements
- refactored some other code with typos to spell words correctly.. no biggie

v3.0.30
- merged in some work by @696GrocuttT PR into this release
- fixed code to do with using up all allowed api counts
- this release will most likely stuff up the current API counter, but after the UTC counter reset all will be right in the world of api counting again

v3.0.29
- changed Peak Time Today/Tomorrow sensor from datetime to time
- changed back the unit for peak measurement to Wh as the sensor is telling the peak/max hours generated forecast for the hour
- added new configuration option for the integration to disable auto polling. Users can then setup their own automation to poll for data when they like (mostly due to the fact that Solcast have changed the API allowance for new accounts to just 10 per day)
- API counter sensor now shows total used instead of allowance remaining as some have 10 others 50. It will 'Exceeded API Allowance' if you have none left


v3.0.27

v3.0.18
- changed api counter return value calculations

v3.0.17
- set the polling api time to 10mins after the hour to give solcast api time to calculate satellite data

v3.0.16

- added timeout for solcast api server connections
- added previous 7 day graph data to the energy dashboard (only works if you are recording data)

v3.0.9
- **users upgrading from v3.0.5 or lover, need to delete the 'solcast.json' file in the HA>config directory to stop any errors**
- renamed sensors with the prefix "solcast_" to help naming sensors easier
- ** you will get double ups of the sensors in the integration because of the naming change. these will show greyed out in the list or with the values like unknown or unavailable etc.. just delete these old sensors one by one from the integration **

v3.0.6
- **users upgrading from v3.0.x need to delete the 'solcast.json' file in the HA>config directory**
- fixed lots of little bugs and problems.
- added ability to add multiple solcast accounts. Just comma seperate the api_keys in the integration config.
- remained API Counter to API Left. shows how many is remaining rather than used count.
- 'actual forecast' data is now only called once, the last api call at sunset. OR during integration install first run.
- forecast data is still called every hour between sunrise and sunset and once at midnight every day.
*Just delete the old API Counter sensor as its not used now*

v3.0.5 beta
- fixed 'this hour' amd 'next hour' sensor values.
- slow down the api polling if more than 1 rooftop to poll.
- fix first hour graph plot data.
- possibly RC1?? will see.

### Polling Imformation
Solcast has a 50 API poll limit per day.
Recently new Solcast Hobbyist accounts only get a limit of 10 API calls per day.
